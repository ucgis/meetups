## Interested in GIS?

Each of our three speakers will give a five to ten minute lightning talk, and then we’ll head into breakout rooms for follow up discussions. Finally, we’ll meet back in the main room to share feedback and impressions. Follow up discussions will take place on the UC GIS slack channel.

## Program
